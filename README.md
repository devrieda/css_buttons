## CSS Buttons

This project contains HTML/CSS to change the visual style of both the 
`<button>` and `<a>` tag using a *button* class. It aims to use semantically 
correct markup and maintain the various button states (in supported browsers).


## Examples

There are two different button examples -- a large and small button.

Tested in IE9, IE10, Safari, Firefox, and Chrome. 

Large Button: 

```
<button type="submit" class="button large_button">Submit</button>
<a href="#" class="button large_button">Submit</a>
```

Small Button:   
  
```
<button type="submit" class="button small_button">Submit/button> 
<a href="#" class="button small_button">Submit</a>
```  

Add the *primary* class to make a button bolded: 

```
<button type="submit" class="button large_button primary">Submit</button>
```

Add the *disabled* class to make a button faded:

```
<button type="submit" class="button large_button disabled">Submit</button>
```
